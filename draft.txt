backend :
- joiSchemas : middleware validatePost,commentPost 
- post image (how it works)
- find out why colt use postSchema.post() in models instead of deleting depencencies in route
- protect the route not just from ejs, but in the router also
- user may input symbols that can break code
- module.exports.isLoggedIn -> if (req.query._method === 'DELETE') { req.session.lastPath = '/posts'; } //prevent error because redirecting on link with post / delete / put method create an error (but why only req.query._method === 'DELETE', not with 'PUT' and 'POST')
but it wont error tho because it return res.redirect('/login') anyway.

frontend :
- evaluate page : know how many not answered (answered / question)
